Would be good if you can setup your enviroment before meetup, so you can save some time.
Read instructions below and if you are having some problems, feel free to [open issue](https://github.com/nodeschool/bratislava/issues) or visit us at chat  [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/nodeschool/bratislava](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/nodeschool/bratislava?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

# Setup your enviroment
### Installing NodeJS

For obvious reasons, having NodeJS installed on your work machine is a must. :smile:

##### Windows

Using Windows 10, however, workflow should be similar for most versions.

* download v4.2.2 from https://nodejs.org/en/ (5.1.0 has problems with npm and VS2015)
* install it regularly

Open up terminal (Windows + R -> 'cmd' -> Enter) and type `node -v`. If it works, you are good to go and you can ignore the stuff below. Otherwise, continue.

* open up **This PC**
* in that window, right click the **PC** icon located above all your hard drives and directories
* in the new window, click **Advanced system settings**
* in the newest window, click **Environment Variables...**
* find the **PATH** variable, click **edit**
* add the following: *YOUR_ABSOLUTE_NODEJS_INSTALL_DIRECTORY/;* and *C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\npm;*
* please note that all PATH variables must be separated with **;**

##### Ubuntu

* open up terminal
* `sudo apt-get install nvm`
* `nvm install 5.1`


##### Mac OS X

Navigate your browser to the [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org). Download your Node.js installation package by clicking on of the big green buttons (we recommend the LTS variant):

Run downloaded file:

Go through the installation process, provide your password when asked:

Your node is installed at this point, but we recommend some *"fininshing touches"*:

- set the ownership of global module folder

  `sudo chown -R YOUR_USER_NAME /usr/local/lib/node_modules`

  replace `YOUR_USER_NAME` in above command by your actual username in macosx. If you don't know your username, run `whoami` to get it printed into console.

- update to latest NPM

  `npm update -g`

Now you can test your node.js & npm installation:

  `node -v`

  `npm -v`
